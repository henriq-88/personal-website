      Since my youth my goal in life has always been to make the world a better place, one line of code at the time. As a student who is hungry to be working, and close to graduating in my master’s in UX/Contents with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, I know my diverse skills and qualifications will make me an asset to my future employer.</p>
      <p>I’m not just a software developer, but also a UX designer (soon to graduate). During my undergraduate studies at The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden I focused on learning the fundamentals of Computer Science. I learned about objected oriented programming (Java) on a deeper level, but we also learned different web practices (AJAX, PHP, Backbone, JavaServer), and more unusual programming paradigms, such as functional- (Haskell) and logical programming (Prolog). Since many assignments was done in projects with other students, we managed most online through versioning services such as GitHub and BitBucket.</p>
      <p>During my last semester at KTH, I was working as a part-time consultant for The Royal Institute of Technology’s consultants (THSK), where I helped to redesign a costumer’s website. Though my time with THSK was short (due to me going to Korea) I learned more in depth about WordPress (HTML, CSS, PHP). I was also responsible for choosing plugins, as well as tweaking them to the customer’s needs. In addition to the technical skills acquired, I also negotiated with the customer and helped to write the project specifications.</p>
      <p>As I progress through my Computer Science bachelor’s program, I noticed how many developers, including myself, was lacking basic usability and user experience knowledge. That’s why changed my major and I entered the UX/Contents master’s program at Yonsei University in Korea. To learn more about the needs of actual users, and how to develop products based on their requirements and feedback. My time at Yonsei University given me invaluable experiences of multiple development processes, from the idea stage, low to high fidelity prototypes, to finished products and services and checking up that it meets the users’ requirements.</p>
      <p>Moreover, moving to another country has helped me view things from a broader perspective and collaborate with people from different cultures. It has also made learn to take responsibilities about myself on a whole different level, as I have learned to live in another country. My reason to go abroad was to take part and explore this more and more globalizing world. And I specifically chose Korea because of my passion for culture and the people’s kindness and energy.</p>
      <p>Coming to Korea as a Swede, I’m in a unique position where I can look at things as both an outsider coming from Sweden, and an insider from my experience with Korea and the Korean culture. I’m certain I can continue to help extending my future employer’s culture, and deliver even better products and services.</p>
      <p>Your's sincerely,</p>
